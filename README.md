What is this? 
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
It's some sort of blog. Every week I talk about something I've found interesting.  My goal is to reflect on it in a way that challenges my own beliefs, and helps me clarify my views.  To do this, I seek to find sources where applicable, however there will undoubtedly be posts just describing my views.


Why is this?
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
I don't write anymore.  At least I haven't recently.  Not in 2+ years.  It's time to change that.  Once a week posts, here we go!
