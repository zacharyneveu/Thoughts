# Explanation
This section goes through a list of principles that best describe the world in my mind. The goal here is not to explain what could be or should be, but what is. To my thinking, there is always a reason why something is the way it is (not necessarily a good one though!). My goal here is to explain how I see things working, and then, if possible, why that came to be. I've tried to order these roughly in the manner I came across them, as one should logically lead to the next with enough intermediate steps.

# Principles
0. The Universe is determined, randomness is only a tool
1. Life happened randomly
2. We are nothing but physical
3. Evolution shapes us in every way
4. People are selfish
5. All truth is relative
