# Outline
+ Companies are NOT people
	+ Companies are made of people
	+ Company is nothing more than the sum of its employees - you can't convince me otherwise
	+ Company should not be offered the same protections afforded to people


## Current Status
+ Debts
	+ Companies are not held accountable for debts as they should be
	+ Because an LLC is "legally" separate from the people running it, debts, lawsuits and more are unable to hold the LLC accountable for more than it is worth, even if the owners have made off with millions.
	+ This massively changes the perceived vs. actual risk of being an owner vs a worker. Owners don't actually take on more risk, if things go south they just go make a new company.

+ Steady pay vs. Equity
	+ Traditionally, companies have traded the rights to employees productivity for a constant salary. This is bullshit for a number of reasons.
	+ The reason employees resort to steady pay is that in a system where their needs are not guaranteed to be met and they live in constant fear of falling below zero for reasons they can't control, a steady income sounds safe compared to the perceived risk of owning equity.

+ Profits
	+ If the value created by the company exceeds their costs, this money currently gets saved or absorbed by owners to varying degrees
	+ Every time this happens, workers are being short-changed. The value they created exceeded what they were paid.
	+ Currently, companies can use those profits to lobby the government. The crime here is not that people can advocate for their opinions, it is the idea that the company is somehow separate from the people or that a small group of people can decide how to allocate the value created by a huge group of people. Monsanto should not be able to lobby for changes to the corn industry without first asking Jane the geneticist and Jim the front desk guy if they're willing to give up her vacation money or new car in order to further their cause. When a very small number of people are given the opportunity to spend money while removing large amounts of personal responsibility for the consequences, the results cannot be expected to be good.
