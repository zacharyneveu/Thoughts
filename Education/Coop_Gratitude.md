## Takeaways

### Make Sure to Interview Well

Taking this job based on a phone interview was, of course, not super avoidable.  With another offer expiring, I made the best choice I could.  I now wish I had asked about some key aspects of working here: team culture, opportunities for further challenges, and management style.  In hindsight, however, it may have made more sense to let the other offer expire, but insist on an in-person, or even second phone interview here. Worst case, the offer dries up and I have to keep looking, best case, I get more info and either take the job, or keep looking. That said, I think it was still the right decision to take this position.  The company is absolutely a place I wouldn't mind working someday, and there have been some great perks (as mentioned above).

### Properly Introduce/Advertise Yourself

Today I am 1.5 weeks from the end of a 8 month co-op.  I was chatting with the engineer who hired me to work on his project, and he asked "are you an electrical engineer?". No wonder I haven't been given any fun hardware projects! After all this time, I find out he hadn't even read my resume, and thought I was just a software person.  Going into next co-op I will definitely have a good about-me set of slides/elevator pitch ready to go so people know who I am and what I'm capable of.

### Culture and People Matter

Going into this co-op, by far my largest considerations were industry and brand recognition.  Going into my next co-op, I will be looking a lot more at team-structure, and day-to-day function.  I am looking for more of a team feel, and definitely looking to work with other software people.  Of course this will have trade-offs.  The biggest ones I can think of are that the total hours spent at work and thinking about work will almost certainly go up.  Additionally, tight teamwork usually involves tight deadlines which adds some stress.

### Fear the Commute

The commute to Bose really wasn't bad.  That said, an extra half hour every day makes a HUGE difference in my quality of life, especially if it saves the frustrations of traffic/gas/tolls/etc.  That said, I'm really glad I didn't move out here to Framingham; it's been really nice to see friends on week nights and stay checked in to campus life. Best case scenario for next co-op? Find a job in the city.

### Department Matters

I've always been into Product Development.  It's glamorous right? Working with next-gen technologies to create great products? It wasn't until this co-op that I realized product development at big companies has little to do with new tech.  Mostly, product development involves integrating what the competitors use at a competitive price-point with minimal bugs.  This is a huge challenge, and is incredibly necessary, however I've found myself constantly fascinated with the work coming out of research areas, and overall I've felt pretty apathetic about the myriad of common features and challenges that constitute the daily working lives of my co-workers.
