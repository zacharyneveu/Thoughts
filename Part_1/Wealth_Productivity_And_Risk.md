# Outline

## Wealth, Needs, and Wants
+ Wealth grows as exponent
	+ Show this is true - market returns, compounding interest etc.
	+ Implications of exponential curves - very slow growth at first, very fast growth later
	+ Starting spot really matters! small intergenerational wealth transfer is actually huge
	+ Wealth below zero (debt) will grow exponentially downwards
	
+ Needs are constant w.r.t. wealth and add noise to graph
	+ Being poor doesn't mean you need less food/shelter/clothes!
	+ Poisson-process: needs are bursty. One health event, car trouble, etc. can wipe out the first several years of wealth accumulation
	+ Compared to early savings/wealth accumulation, needs have a huge impact. Compared to late wealth accumulation needs are vanishing.

+ Wants are linear or even logarithmic
	+ There's no denying that rich people buy fancier cars, bigger houses, yachts, etc.
	+ Prices for most of these items increase linearly - an extra bedroom adds a pretty fixed price to the house
	+ Some costs are sub-linear - more upfront capital reduces long term cost
	+ Wealth spent on wants often recoverable compared to needs (i.e. you can sell a vacation home for what you bought it for, but not true with the pants you're wearing) 

## Productivity

+ Productivity is bell-shaped
	+ Measuring here as what impact YOU create, not what other people are able to create using your wealth. Investing in a company does not count as productivity, managing a company does.
	+ Does not directly accumulate like wealth either.
	+ More wealth != more productivity

+ Impacts of lack-of-wealth on productivity
	+ Productivity often requires capital - need a coffee maker to run a cafe!
	+ If needs aren't met this will severely impact productivity.
		+ No car = no job, poor health = sick time etc.

+ Impacts of wealth on productivity
	+ Exponential nature of wealth means if your savings grow, your earnings pale in comparison to the interest alone
	+ Accumulation of wants takes focus away from productivity

## Risk

+ Risk is about where you could land, not how far you fall
	+ People with lots of wealth are inherently able to tolerate much more risk without meaningful consequences
	+ People with little or negative wealth cannot take small risks that could be very productive i.e.
